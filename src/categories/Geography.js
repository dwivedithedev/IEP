 * File Name:- Geography.js (Javascript File with JSX Code)
 * Description:- This file consists of the the code which

 * It has the WebVR code for state changes to be done to generate
 * dynamically the environment in Virtual Reality. The function calls
 * passes the 'preset' and 'valuetext' to dynamically update the state
 * of the react to update changes in text board and environment in the preview.
