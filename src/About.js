                  In this project of EducationalVR, The objective is to make a
                  platform (as in a web application) to help people learn and
                  understand and more importantly experience complex topics in
                  different subjects with the help of virtual reality. The main
                  goal is aimed to make complex topics, easier to understand and
                  effective for learning for the students and easier to be
                  taught by teachers as well. This will help in retaining the
                  concepts in student's mind in a better manner so that they can
                  perform better in further education.
